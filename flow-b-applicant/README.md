# Flow B – Invited Applicant

This flow displays the matching result when a candidate is invited by a company to take the personality test for a specific job.

It highlights:
-Match percentage
-Alignment on key traits (table)
-Explanation of why it’s a good fit
-Call-to-action buttons: Accept, Not Interested



## 🔍 Bonus: Trait-Level Alignment Prototype

As an extra concept, I explored a more detailed way of visualizing the match by showing the alignment between the candidate's traits and the company's expectations.

This makes the logic behind the match more transparent and easier to interpret.
