# Apropos Matching Flows

This repository contains low-fidelity UI mockups for three main user flows within the Apropos recruitment platform:

- `flow-a-jobseeker`: Applicants who proactively take the personality test to discover matching companies.
- `flow-b-invited`: Applicants who were invited by a company to take the test for a specific position.
- `flow-company`: Recruiters reviewing candidates based on personality match and other filters.

Each folder contains HTML, CSS, and JS files kept separate for clarity.

The mockups are responsive and kept in grayscale to allow flexible styling decisions later.
